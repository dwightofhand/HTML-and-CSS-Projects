<p> This fortress built by Nature for herself,<br>
	Against infection and the hand of war,<br>
	This happy breed of men, this little world,<br>
	This precious stone set in the silver sea,<br>
	Which serves it in the office of a wall,<br>
	Or as a moat defensive to a house,<br>
	This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this...ENGLAND!!&copy;
